# Hello! I'm Nicole! Backend Developer

## About me
My name is Nicole Lapidus. In 2020, I began my academic journey at Universidad de San Andr√©s in collaboration with Digital House, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Digital Business. This program offers a comprehensive education that covers backend and frontend development, database management, digital marketing, big data, artificial intelligence, and other relevant disciplines. I completed my studies in July 2024, experiencing a mix of pride and uncertainty. My achievement lies not only in successfully finishing my education but also in gaining experiences that contribute to my personal and professional growth.
